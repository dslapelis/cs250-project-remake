# cs250-project-remake

This project was for RIT's CSCI-250 class. Dijkstra's algorithm had to be implemented in MIPS Assembly. 

I implemented this algorithm http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/printing-paths-dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm/ 
This program literally is the MIPS version of this.

* STEPS FOR SUCCESS *
1. n (number of nodes), m (number of edges), and S (source node) into an array which holds 3 32-bit values.
2. read edge data into a 1D array (you access each element by taking the row * N + column)
3. make a function that prints this data
4. implement this dijkstra's algorithm http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/printing-paths-dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm/ 
5. write a print function that prints each node, the recursive print function, and then gets the weight from your distance array
6. ???
7. PROFIT!!!
